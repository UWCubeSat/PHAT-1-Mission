This folder is meant to hold the BSP (board support package) files, which will include both the root bsp.c/.h source files that all subsystems will use, along with the individual BSP implementations that will exist per-board.  These should ultimately include:  

- MSP430FR5994 LaunchPad (aka MSP-EXP430FR5994)
- MSP430FR5994 Test Board(s)
- MSP430-Based Final Flight Boards
- MSP432-Base Test and Flight Boards, if required
